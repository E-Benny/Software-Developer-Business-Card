## Software Developer Business Card
This repository contains an HTML file that displays a modern business info layout of a software developer. This project was developed using HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design and Javascriptreact (JSX).

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Simply open the HTML file to use it. If you would like to fork the design, make sure you have a SASS Compiler installed in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code app to convert the SCSS file to CSS. Without the compiler, the SCSS version would not render any stylish changes to the HTML file.

## Project Status
